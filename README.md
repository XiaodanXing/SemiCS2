## Highlight
In this work, we propose a novel strategy for medical image synthesis, namely Unsupervised Mask (UM)-guided synthesis, to obtain both synthetic images and segmentations using limited manual segmentation labels. 

1. We first develop a **superpixel based** algorithm to generate unsupervised structural guidance and then design a conditional generative model to synthesize images and annotations simultaneously from those unsupervised masks in a semi-supervised multi-task setting. 
2. In addition, we devise a **multi-scale multi-task Fr√©chet Inception Distance (MM-FID)** and **multi-scale multi-task standard deviation (MM-STD)** to harness both fidelity and variety evaluations of synthetic CT images. With multiple analyses on different scales, we could produce stable image quality measurements with high reproducibility. 

Compared with the segmentation mask guided synthesis, our UM-guided synthesis provided high-quality synthetic images with significantly higher fidelity, variety, and utility (p < 0.05 by Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test).
